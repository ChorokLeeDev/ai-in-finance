API Authentication

Our API uses JWT tokens for authentication. To get started:

1. Register for an API key at developer.example.com
2. Include the key in the Authorization header
3. Tokens expire after 24 hours
4. Use the refresh endpoint to get new tokens

Example:
Authorization: Bearer your_token_here
